Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset provided by Keras. The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

The goal of this project is to classify each image into one of the 10 digit classes (0 through 9) with high accuracy using a simple neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras.

The MNIST dataset is included in the Keras library and can be easily loaded using keras.datasets.mnist. The dataset contains grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels. Each image represents a single handwritten digit from 0 to 9.

Training set: 60,000 images
Test set: 10,000 images
Each image is labeled with the digit it represents, making it a supervised learning problem.

Model Architecture
The neural network model used in this project consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: Accepts the 28x28 grayscale images.
Flatten Layer: Flattens the 2D input images into a 1D vector.
Hidden Layer 1: A dense layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation function.

Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit class) and sigmoid activation function which outputs the probabilities for each class.
Summary of the Model

Model: "sequential"

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras (included in TensorFlow 2.x)
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

Train the Model:
The model will be trained on the MNIST dataset, and you'll see the training and validation accuracy/loss for each epoch.

Evaluate the Model:
The model have been tested on the test dataset, and we have seen the accuracy achieved on unseen data and i have try to visualize the confussion matrix using seaborn 

Visualize Predictions (Optional):
The notebook includes code to visualize a few predictions made by the model, along with their corresponding true labels.

Results
After training the neural network, the model typically achieves an accuracy of around 98% on the test dataset. The exact results may vary depending on various factors such as the number of epochs, batch size, and initial random weights.

accuracy: 98.25%

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic but effective approach to handwritten digit recognition using a simple neural network. While more complex models (such as Convolutional Neural Networks) can achieve even higher accuracy, this project serves as a solid introduction to the basics of deep learning and image classification.
